## Supabase backend setup (quick)

1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com and note your Project URL and anon/public API key.

2. Create the DB tables (SQL) using Supabase SQL editor. Example schema:

```sql
create table if not exists reader_progress (
   id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
   user_id text not null,
   item_id text not null,
   progress int default 0,
   updated_at timestamptz default now(),
   constraint ux_reader_progress unique (user_id, item_id)
);

create table if not exists highlights (
   id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
   user_id text not null,
   item_id text not null,
   text text,
   position jsonb,
   created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists bookmarks (
   id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
   user_id text not null,
   item_id text not null,
   position int,
   created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

3. In the project root create a `.env` file and add your Supabase creds (you can copy `.env.example`).

4. Install the new dependency and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. The frontend helpers are in `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` and `src/lib/supabaseApi.js` — wire them into your auth flow and `ReaderView` to persist progress/highlights/bookmarks.

Auth & RLS notes
-----------------

If you plan to persist user data, enable Supabase Auth and add Row Level Security (RLS) policies so users can only read/write their own rows. Example SQL for enabling RLS and a simple policy:

```sql
-- enable RLS
alter table reader_progress enable row level security;

-- allow users to insert/update their own progress (supabase auth uses the `auth.uid()` function)
create policy "users_can_modify_own_progress" on reader_progress
   for all using (user_id = auth.uid()) with check (user_id = auth.uid());

-- repeat similar policies for highlights and bookmarks
``` 

On the frontend, use `supabase.auth` to get the current user (or listen to auth changes) and pass `user.id` into `ReaderView` as the `userId` prop.
